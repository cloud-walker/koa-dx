# Koa DX

An experiment to try to make it work a Koa server with a series of developer experience goodies, like:

- [ ] auto generate router API typings (es. request params / payload)
- [ ] auto generate an http client to query the API, with typings and docs throught comments
- [ ] semi-auto generate a docs route, listing all the routes and types

## Other repos

- [koa-dx-web](https://github.com/cloud-walker/koa-dx-web): a standalone React frontend to test out the expriment.
